# wso-docs
The documentation for William Students Online's code, server configs, and onboarding.

Because notes were all over the place, and it became hard to fix things after a previous year implemented them.
Also, all of it was in Markdown to begin with, so converting it to `mdbook` format was trivial (a literal copy-paste).
