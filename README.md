# wso-docs
The documentation for William Students Online's code, server configs, and onboarding.

## Why make this?
Because notes were all over the place, and it became hard to fix things after a previous class year implemented them. Keeping everything in one place makes it easy to track, easier to maintain, and reduces the time needed to figure out what's going on.

Also, all of it was in Markdown to begin with, so converting it to `mdbook` format was trivial (a literal copy-paste in most cases). It also makes it really easy to reuse existing documentation, since GitHub uses Markdown, so documentation written for this or elsewhere is portable.

## Anything else?
* If you're doing the onboarding, the files for it are located within this repository (so if you clone this, you'll get the onboarding files as well as this documentation).
* Some things may be out of date. Sorry about that! Open an issue if that's the case.
